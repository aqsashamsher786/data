          <Marginer direction="vertical" margin="1rem" />
          Leverage AI to prevent fraudulent activity within each form of communication. Uncover fraudulent behavior within text and structured data sources through text and numerical anomaly detection techniques. For image anomaly detection, our team of data scientists will utilize CNN and GANs. Additionally, the latest form of fraud detection is DeepFake detection, which uncovers the manipulation and alteration of audio and video. We leverage powerful GANs to detect if a file is a manipulated DeepFake and protect your organization and clients from this advanced fraudulent behavior.
